customer data management 
For your website, considering it's for internal use to manage customer details and issues, here's a structure and key features you can implement:

1. Login & Security
Password-Protected Access: Ensure only authorized personnel can access the admin page by implementing a login system with role-based authentication (admin, user).
Encryption: Store sensitive information (passwords, FTTH numbers, etc.) in an encrypted form.
Session Management: Use secure session tokens (JWT) to manage user sessions after login.
2FA (Optional): Implement two-factor authentication for added security.
2. Database Design
MongoDB: You can use MongoDB as your database, which will be ideal for managing the structured data (customer details) in JSON-like documents.
Fields:
Name
FTTH Number
Mobile Number
Port Number
Area
Place
Connections
Ensure each record has a unique identifier (like FTTH number or customer ID).
3. Data Entry & Importing
Add/Edit Data: Provide forms to manually add, edit, or delete customer data.
CSV Import: Enable the admin to upload CSV files with customer details to bulk insert or update data in the database.
CSV headers should match your database schema for easy import.
Validation: Validate the CSV file format before processing and inserting data.
4. Search Functionality
Implement search filters in the admin dashboard to search across any field (name, FTTH number, mobile number, etc.).
Support fuzzy search for partial matches (e.g., entering part of the mobile number should return relevant results).
MongoDBâ€™s find function with indexing can speed up search queries.
5. Admin Dashboard
Customer Overview: A table displaying all customer details with sorting, filtering, and pagination.
Detailed View: Clicking on a customer record should show a detailed view of all their information.
CSV Export: Allow exporting customer data in CSV format for backup or reporting purposes.
6. Tech Stack
Frontend: React (Material-UI for design, forms, and tables)
Backend: Node.js + Express.js for API handling and database interaction
Database: MongoDB (Atlas for cloud-hosted solution)
Security: Implement authentication using JWT, password hashing using bcrypt, and role-based access control.
7. Additional Features
Audit Logs: Keep logs of who added or modified the data for accountability.
Responsive Design: Ensure the website works well on both desktop and mobile devices for easy access.
Data Backup: Regular backups of the database to prevent data loss.
